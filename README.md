# Project Overview
The goal of the Module 6 Challenge was to create three separate outpuuts:
 - Weather database showing the weather status for 2000 random latitude and longitude locations
 - Vacation tool that allows users to enter inputs for the minimum and maximum temperatures of travel locations. The tool will then identify hotels near those cities.
 - Vacation itinerary that will show users the travel rote for their trip based on cities that will be visited. 

# Project Artifacts
As part of the project, various dataframes were created to accomplish the goals of each deliverable. These were then exported to CSV and/or shown on Google Maps using API and widgets within Jupyter Notebook. The images that created as part of this project are shown below.
